- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Janith
This is my personal and active repository to keep a record of my past and present projects to date. 
I haven't been great at keeping a record, but stay tuned with the work to come!

- ðŸŒ± Of particular note, 

You can find my route to learning machine learning. 
I have kept a record of the: courses I have taken; the tutorials followed; and any other source material which I found useful.

On my journey, I was particularly interested in 'automated image recognition' type problems where I got experience using OpenCV, Scikit-image and some Tensorflow. 

I reached my first major milestone where I wrote my final year dissertation on the aspect of building a robust cnn which may be more resistant to various adversarial attacks. 

You can find this as well as all the above, linked in their relevant folders.
