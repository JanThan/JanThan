I currently work as a Product Engineer in the Biotechnology sector with an emphasis on the lifecycle management of electronic components within the electrical cabinets of machinery.  

I am passionate about furthering my understanding of best practices wrt electronic and electrical design and use this github as a respository for active and past projects in addition to a general record of reading material/ notes which I've collected on the way.
